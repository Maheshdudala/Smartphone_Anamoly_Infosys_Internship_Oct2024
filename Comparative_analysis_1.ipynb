    "## **IQR (Interquartile Range) method** and **Z-score method**\n",
    "### 1. **Approach and Calculation**:\n",
    "   - **IQR Method**:\n",
    "      - This method calculates outliers based on the interquartile range. Outliers are values that fall below `Q1 - 1.5 * IQR` or above `Q3 + 1.5 * IQR`.\n",
    "      - It only requires the 25th percentile (Q1) and 75th percentile (Q3), so it's easy to compute and is not affected by the mean or standard deviation of the data.\n",
    "   - **Z-score Method**:\n",
    "      - The Z-score method uses the mean and standard deviation to identify outliers. Outliers are values with Z-scores outside the range ±3, meaning they are more than three standard deviations from the mean.\n",
    "      - This method relies on calculating the mean and standard deviation, which assumes the data follows a roughly normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Suitability for Different Data Distributions**:\n",
    "   - **IQR Method**:\n",
    "      - Works well for **skewed distributions** and **non-normal data**, as it doesn’t assume any underlying distribution.\n",
    "      - It is **robust to extreme values** because the IQR is based on the middle 50% of the data.\n",
    "   - **Z-score Method**:\n",
    "      - More appropriate for **normally distributed data** where mean and standard deviation are meaningful.\n",
    "      - It can be **influenced by extreme values** or skewed data since outliers significantly affect the mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Interpretability and Results**:\n",
    "   - **IQR Method**:\n",
    "      - Provides a clear interpretation of what constitutes an outlier in terms of the quartiles. Outliers are identified relative to the range of the middle 50% of data, which can be easier to understand for non-technical users.\n",
    "      - As shown in the boxplot visualization, it’s intuitive to see outliers beyond the “whiskers” in boxplots.\n",
    "   - **Z-score Method**:\n",
    "      - Z-score identifies outliers by their distance from the mean in terms of standard deviations, which provides a more statistical interpretation.\n",
    "      - In histograms with Z-score lines at ±3 standard deviations, the visual helps distinguish outliers but can be less intuitive when distributions are not normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Impact of Outliers on Results**:\n",
    "   - **IQR Method**:\n",
    "      - Since it doesn’t rely on the mean, the IQR method is less impacted by the presence of outliers in the dataset. It is effective at identifying extreme values in skewed data.\n",
    "   - **Z-score Method**:\n",
    "      - Outliers themselves affect the mean and standard deviation, so they can skew results, especially with non-normal data.\n",
    "      - The Z-score method may overlook outliers in skewed distributions where data inherently has more values on one side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Performance and Complexity**:\n",
    "   - **IQR Method**:\n",
    "      - Computationally simpler as it only requires quantile calculations.\n",
    "      - Ideal for datasets where computation speed is a concern, and data does not follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "   - **Z-score Method**:\n",
    "      - Slightly more complex due to the calculation of mean and standard deviation but generally efficient with modern libraries.\n",
    "      - More suitable for data analysis scenarios where statistical distribution is known and ideally normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Visualization and Interpretation in Code**:\n",
    "   - **IQR Method**:\n",
    "      - The boxplot visualization is intuitive for spotting outliers by visually emphasizing data points beyond the whiskers.\n",
    "      - Summary output includes bounds, counts, and IQR, making it straightforward to interpret results.\n",
    "   - **Z-score Method**:\n",
    "      - The histogram with KDE and mean ±3 SD lines provides insight into the distribution with visual markers for outliers.\n",
    "      - Z-score outlier frequency chart adds context to identify the columns most affected by outliers.\n",

    "### **Conclusion**:\n",
    "- **Use the IQR method** if your data is skewed, contains extreme values, or doesn’t follow a normal distribution, as it offers more robustness to those conditions.\n",
    "- **Use the Z-score method** if your data is normally distributed and you prefer a statistical approach to outlier detection, as it provides a standardized way to flag deviations from the mean."
