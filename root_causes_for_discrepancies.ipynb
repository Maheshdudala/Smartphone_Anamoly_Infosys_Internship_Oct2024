    "## Understanding High Accuracy with Low F1 Score, Precision, and Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "When you get high accuracy but low F1 score, precision, and recall, it often suggests issues related to **class imbalance** or model misinterpretation. Here are some potential root causes:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Class Imbalance\n",
    "- **Explanation**: If one class is significantly more common than others, the model can achieve high accuracy by mostly predicting the majority class, while performance on the minority class is poor.\n",
    "- **Impact**: This typically results in low precision, recall, and F1 score, especially on the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Threshold Choice ( contamination rate )\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Many classification models use a default decision threshold of 0.5. This may not be suitable for imbalanced data, leading to poor detection of the minority class.\n",
    "- **Impact**: Adjusting this threshold can improve precision or recall, directly affecting F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Overfitting on the Majority Class\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The model may learn patterns for the dominant class better than for the minority class, leading to a bias toward the majority.\n",
    "- **Impact**: This often increases false negatives or false positives, depending on the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Poor Model Generalization\n",
    "- **Explanation**: If the model is too complex (overfitting), it may perform well on training data but fail on new data, particularly on the minority class.\n",
    "- **Impact**: The result is a high accuracy but low recall and precision, harming the F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Incorrect Metric Interpretation\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Accuracy doesnâ€™t account for class-wise performance. In applications that demand high precision and recall (e.g., medical diagnostics), focusing solely on accuracy can be misleading.\n",
    "- **Impact**: Relying on accuracy alone might not give you the full picture, especially when class-wise performance matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Address the Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider using these techniques to improve F1 score, precision, and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resample the Dataset**\n",
    "   - **Option 1**: Oversample the minority class.\n",
    "   - **Option 2**: Undersample the majority class.\n",
    "2. **Adjust Decision Thresholds**\n",
    "   - Experiment with threshold values based on the desired precision-recall balance.\n",
    "3. **Use Different Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "   - Use metrics like **F1 score** or **AUC-ROC** to tune models instead of accuracy.\n",
    "4. **Choose Robust Models for Imbalanced Data**\n",
    "   - Models like ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) can often handle class imbalance better.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps should help improve the F1 score, precision, and recall, making the model more reliable for cases with imbalanced classes.\n"
