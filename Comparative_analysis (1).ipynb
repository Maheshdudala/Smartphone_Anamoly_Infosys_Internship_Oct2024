    "| **Purpose**           | Detects outliers by isolating samples in a random forest.    | Detects outliers by comparing local density of each point to its neighbors. |\n",
    "| **Contamination**     | Requires setting contamination level.                        | Also requires contamination but heavily influenced by `n_neighbors`. |\n",
    "| **Output Labels**     | `1` for normal, `-1` for anomaly (mapped to `0` and `1`).    | Same output labels as Isolation Forest but based on local density.  |\n",
    "| **Hyperparameters**   | Key parameter: `contamination`.                              | Key parameters: `n_neighbors` and `contamination`.                  |\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Isolation Forest**: Suitable for large datasets with potentially high dimensions, providing stable and scalable anomaly detection with minimal parameter tuning. Recommended for general anomaly detection, especially when a simple contamination adjustment can produce good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Ideal for data with local density variations or when anomalies exist in specific clusters. However, this approach requires more parameter tuning, specifically for `n_neighbors`, to achieve optimal performance and accuracy. It is best suited for small to medium-sized datasets with local clusters."
